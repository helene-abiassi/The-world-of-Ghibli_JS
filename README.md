My Studio Ghibli API project

This is a student project I worked on in August 2023, as part of my web development training at Code Academy Berlin.
The project's goal was to get us familiar with Javascript, and was complemented with classes on loops, functions, DOM manipulation methods, and events.
For this project, we were also introduced to Postman, and were required to use live data from an API of our choice.

I used the Studio Ghibli API, in order to showcase its different endpoints and data, and created a website that performed a live fetch to the API to display different types of data on my website.

Programs used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Postman
- Bootstrap

API can be found here: https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/
Live preview of the site can be found here: https://studio-ghibli-heleneapi-project.netlify.app/people
