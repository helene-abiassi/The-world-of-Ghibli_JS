<h2>The world of Studio Ghibli </h2>

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>This is a student project I worked on in August 2023, as part of my web development training at Code Academy Berlin.</p>
<p>The project's goal was to get us familiar with Javascript, and was complemented with classes on loops, functions, DOM manipulation methods, and events.</p>
<p>For this project, we were also introduced to Postman, and were required to use live data from an API of our choice.</p>

<p>I used the Studio Ghibli API, in order to showcase its different endpoints and data, and created a website that performed a live fetch to the API to display different types of data on my website.</p>
